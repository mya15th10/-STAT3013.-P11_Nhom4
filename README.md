- **Key Features**:
  - Utilizes libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
  - Stores raw data into structured formats such as CSV.
  - Includes error-handling mechanisms for robust scraping.

### 3. **`dataset.ipynb`**
- **Description**: Handles data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Key Features**:
  - Cleans and normalizes data.
  - Performs descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand trends and patterns.
  - Outputs processed datasets for machine learning tasks.

### 4. **`random_forest.ipynb`**
- **Description**: Builds a Random Forest model for classification or regression tasks.
- **Key Features**:
